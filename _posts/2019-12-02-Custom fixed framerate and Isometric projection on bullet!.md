title: Custom fixed framerate and Isometric projection on bullets!

summary: 'Finally I''m getting a good grasp on how to manage timing precisely on these bullets. No more stutters or inconsistencies!<br>On top of that I toyed around with the isometric projection. The entities and
    bullets behaviors are now taking that projection into account correctly.<br>I''m now confident enough about that key part of the game to move on to reimplementing
    the player character''s part of the core gameplay.<br>How to structure correctly the code according to these mechanics is still quite
    a challenge for me. I will try to keep it simple though as the priority is on
    proving the potential of the concept.'
changelog:
  - Add custom fixed framerate and time tracking
