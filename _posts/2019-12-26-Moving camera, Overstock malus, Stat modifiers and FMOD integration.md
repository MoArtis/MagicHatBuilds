summary: "The title says it all.<br>I feel that the overstock malus (big speed decrease
    and prevent attack/absorb inputs) will work pretty well for this kind of game.
    But for now, the enemy and the map are still way too rough to judge the absorb
    / attack part of the core GP loop. So, the next build should introduce the room
    to room system and hopefully some more test content for the enemies and their
    attacks (including bullet types).<br>I also really to have a look at the resistance
    / weakness system. It is after the main pillar of the game: Strategically absorb
    the right bullets to use them against the right enemy in the room. \"Right\"
    still need to be defined / experiment with though. My experience with this kind
    of game is usually to focus on smaller enemies that add chaos to the more predictable
    pattern of the unique, big enemy. I feel the rooms should be designed around
    that idea (and its variants).\r"
