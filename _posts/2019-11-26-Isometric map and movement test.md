build_webgl_name: MH_WebGL
build_width: 960
build_height: 540
summary: "On top of the most basic movement and aim function, that build is testing
    the integration of having elevated parts in the level.<br>
	It's not enough to tell
    us if having different levels of floor heights is interesting but I can already say that it is cumbersome to integrate. And it leads to issues about how the enemies' patterns will adapt to a player staying on these elevated positions.<br>
    I would advise against it and stick to the \"flat\" design of Enter the Gungeon
    or Isaac. Pillars and other \"blockers\" are fine though.\r"
changelog:
  - Add Basic controls
